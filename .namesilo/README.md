Wrappers for all NameSilo API calls.

Some methods have been 'fluffed out' to be more idiomatic in JS land, some are simply generated wrappers around an POST request.

### TODO
- [x] Simplify calling of endpoints with single argument
- [ ] Live integration tests against sandbox API
- [ ] Should probably bring in eslint
